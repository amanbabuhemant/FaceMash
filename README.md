# FaceMash

FaceMash is a website project inspired by the movie "The Social Network." It recreates the concept of the original FaceMash website, allowing users to compare and rate the attractiveness of different images.

## Features

- Image Comparison: Users can view two random faces side by side and vote for the more attractive one.
- Rating System: Faces are ranked based on the number of votes received, creating a leaderboard of the most attractive faces.
- User Interaction: Users can actively participate by voting, contributing to the ranking of faces.
- Randomization: Faces are randomly selected for comparison, ensuring an unbiased voting process.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The backend is built using Python, specifically the Flask framework and Flask_SQLAlchemy for database.
- HTML/CSS: The frontend is created using HTML and CSS for the website's structure and styling.
- SQLite: The database management system used to store voting data.
